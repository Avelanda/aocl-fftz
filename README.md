AOCL-FFTZ
=========

AOCL-FFTZ is a high performance Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library developed
by AMD supporting advanced optimizations for AMD’s "Zen"-based CPUs.
The library computes FFTs of both (i) complex and (ii) real data of any size
and dimension, in both forward and backward directions, with support for
in-place and out-of-place result placements.

The kernels in this library are vectorized to speed-up the single-threaded core
performance. The library supports the computations of parallel FFTs by taking
advantage of shared-memory parallelism using OpenMP threads.

AOCL-FFTZ introduces a generic and unified API set for supporting
precision types (single-precision and double-precision), and both the
single-threaded and multi-threaded execution modes.
The library uses a dynamic dispatcher feature to run efficiently and portably
across different x86 based systems.
A test bench is supported for performance and functional tests including the
accuracy tests. GTest-based unit testing framework is also supported by the
library.

CPU Architecture Support and FMA Requirements
---------------------------------------------
AOCL-FFTZ leverages advanced CPU features for optimal performance:

**FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) Support:**
- The library uses FMA3 instructions in SIMD kernels when `ENABLE_FMA` is ON (default)
- `ENABLE_FMA` is forced OFF regardless of the option when `ENABLE_INSTRUCTIONS_UPTO` is `None` or `AVX128` only.
- On Linux, when FMA is enabled and `ENABLE_INSTRUCTIONS_UPTO` is `AVX256` or `AVX512`, AVX128 and AVX256 kernels are compiled with `-mfma -ffp-contract=fast`, and AVX512 kernels are compiled with `-ffp-contract=fast`.
- On Windows, FMA intrinsics in AVX128/AVX256 kernels are gated off at compile time regardless of `ENABLE_FMA`

**Runtime Behavior:**
- The library automatically detects CPU capabilities at runtime and selects the highest usable SIMD tier (AVX512 → AVX256 → AVX128 → scalar C).
- On Linux with `ENABLE_FMA` enabled (default), AVX128 and AVX256 kernels require FMA at runtime; if FMA is unavailable, the library uses scalar C kernels.
- On Windows, or when `ENABLE_FMA` is disabled, AVX128 kernels require only AVX support.
- If AVX is not supported, the library executes using the standard C (scalar) implementation.

**SIMD ISA Support:**
- The library uses x86 SIMD AVX128, AVX256 and AVX512 instructions when available
- Library uses dynamic dispatcher to automatically detect the CPU capabilities and
  dispatch the optimal ISA kernels based on selector model


Multi-threading with OpenMP
---------------------------

AOCL-FFTZ currently supports Multi-threading through OpenMP. To enable it, turn on the CMake option `ENABLE_MULTI_THREADING`.
Additionally, you can also provide a custom OpenMP library through the `OpenMP_libomp_LIBRARY` option to override system OpenMP library.

Note: `aoclfftz_execute_io` is safe to call concurrently on a shared handle.
`aoclfftz_execute` is not; call it from a single thread per handle.

Running Test Bench On Linux & Windows
-------------------------------------
The AOCL-FFTZ test bench supports multiple options in order to compute, validate & benchmark FFT.<br>
The test bench is a development tool and is not installed; run it from the build directory.<br>
Following are a few sample commands to use and test with the test bench:

* The test bench can be run by using the following syntax: <br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench [OPTIONS]... PROBLEM_SIZE`

* Use the following command to set the precision for FFT: <br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench -p/--precision <d/f>`

* Use the following command to set the data model for FFT: <br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench -m/--data-model <l/i>`

* Use the following command to run the test bench with the requested bench type: <br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench -b/--bench-type <p/a>`

* Use the following command to run the test bench with the requested FFT type:<br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench -f/--fft-type <c2c>`

* To check other options for test bench use the following command:<br>
  `./aocl_fftz_bench -h/--help`

Running tests with CTest
------------------------
Use the AOCL_TEST_COVERAGE option to enable testing with CTest:
- `OFF`: Disables all tests (default)
- `STANDARD`: Enables standard test suite
- `EXHAUSTIVE`: Enables both standard and exhaustive test suite (exhaustive suite contains a much larger set of test cases for comprehensive coverage)

Note: `ACCURACY_WITH_DFT` enables running tests with DFT as an additional validation method.
      This adds another verification mechanism to the set of accuracy tests that the test bench uses for verification.

Here are a few sample commands that can be executed within the build directory to run test cases with CTest.

To run all the tests<br>
`ctest`

To run only TestBench<br>

Linux  : `ctest -R TESTBENCH`<br>
Windows : `ctest -C <Release/Debug> -R TESTBENCH`

To run GTest test cases for a specific test case<br>
`ctest -R <TEST CASE>`

FFTW wrapper tests
-------------------------------
Build the wrapper and its GTest suite with strict warnings enabled:
```
cmake -B <build directory> <CMakeLists.txt directory> \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DAOCL_TEST_COVERAGE=STANDARD \
  -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON \
  -DBUILD_THIRD_PARTY_WRAPPERS=ON \
  -DENABLE_STRICT_WARNINGS=ON
cmake --build <build directory> --parallel
```

The test names use `KNOWN_DIVERGENCE` for explicit AOCL-vs-FFTW differences
and `PRODUCTION_BLOCKED` for disabled regressions that depend on production
fixes. The wisdom and miscellaneous suites also pin documented wrapper stubs.
These groups can be selected directly by test-name regular expressions:
```
ctest --test-dir <build directory> --output-on-failure \
  -R "^FftwWrapper" \
  -E "KNOWN_DIVERGENCE|FftwWrapperWisdomTest|FftwWrapperMiscTest|PRODUCTION_BLOCKED"
ctest --test-dir <build directory> --output-on-failure \
  -R "KNOWN_DIVERGENCE|FftwWrapperWisdomTest|FftwWrapperMiscTest"
ctest --test-dir <build directory> -N -R PRODUCTION_BLOCKED
```

Running source code coverage using GCOV
---------------------------------------

**Prerequisites :** <br>
1. gcov
2. lcov
3. genhtml

To measure source code coverage, set `CODE_COVERAGE=ON` while configuring the CMake build.<br>
Build with the custom target option 'code-coverage' to execute tests and generate code coverage data.
The code coverage reports are generated in the build directory under subdirectory called 'coverage/html_report'. Open the HTML files in browser to view the coverage information.

Sample command to obtain code coverage report :
```
cmake --build <build directory> --target install code-coverage
```

Running Valgrind and sanitizer checks using CTest
--------------------------------------------------

To perform memory checks using Valgrind or ASAN, enable the relevant build options on Linux while configuring CMake.
`VALGRIND`, `ASAN` and `UBSAN` are supported only on Linux.
Please note that `VALGRIND` requires `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and cannot be combined with `ASAN` or `UBSAN`.

Sample commands for Valgrind :

Build :
```
cmake -B <build directory> <CMakeLists.txt directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DVALGRIND=ON
```

Run :
```
ctest -T memcheck
```

Sample commands for ASAN :

Build :
```
cmake -B <build directory> <CMakeLists.txt directory> -DASAN=ON
```

Run :
```
ctest
```

ASAN and UBSAN can be combined in a single build:
```
cmake -B <build directory> <CMakeLists.txt directory> \
  -DASAN=ON -DUBSAN=ON -DBUILD_THIRD_PARTY_WRAPPERS=ON
cmake --build <build directory> --parallel
ctest --test-dir <build directory> --output-on-failure -R "^FftwWrapper"
```

Generating Documentation
------------------------
- To generate documentation, specify the `-DBUILD_DOC=ON` option while building.
- Documents will be generated in HTML format in the folder __docs/sphinx/html__ .
  Open index.html file from the folder in any browser to view the documentation.
- The following packages are expected before running CMake with `-DBUILD_DOC=ON` option:
   1. Doxygen.
   2. Python packages:
      - Sphinx
      - rocm_docs
      - breathe
      - myst_parser
- CMake halts if required packages are missing by providing directives for installing the absent packages.
